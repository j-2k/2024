# 2024

2023, was relatively successful, but I don't remember everything I did, so this time I will try tracking the main things I want to do for 2024. List isn't based on any order, but I must complete all prerequisites before tackling a topic.  
Importance is the only thing in order ranging from high, mid, & low.

### High
- Triangle with any Graphics Specialization (DX11 or OGL)
- Textured Mesh with Lighting, in any Graphics Specialization
- Portfolio Website from scratch using Threejs & a [FE Framework](https://jamstack.org/generators/) (SSG suggested by a colleague)

### Mid
- Shader Showcase 2024 (Unity, 2023's showcase was decent!)

### Low
- ...

## 2023 Notes
### Some important notes done during 2023 or the first month of 2024
- Real-Time Raytracer
- Software Rasterizer
- Shell Texturing
- Many Random Shaders done in the 2023 Shader Showcase Project
- Shadertoy magic
